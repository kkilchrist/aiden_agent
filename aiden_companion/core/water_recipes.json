    "description": "For intense Naturals & Anaerobics (Fruit Bombs, Experimental Processes).",
    "recipe": {
      "buffer_concentrate_g": 50,

      "distilled_water_g": 860
    },
    "final_specs": "KH: 50 ppm, GH: 90 ppm",
    "rationale": "Higher buffer tames overly aggressive acidity for better balance. Higher hardness ensures the dense, sugary compounds in these beans are fully extracted."
